## ./Baseline/
Contains a single deployment of a traditional Cycamore reactor archetype along with the corresponding analysis notebook and output file.

## ./EVER/
Houses the Enrichment Versatile non-Equilibrium Reactor (EVER), a generic Cyclus archetype that has the capability to update the recipe of fuel in a reactor.

## ./CLOVER/ (in progress)
Houses the Core LOading Versatile non-Equilibrium Reactor (CLOVER), a generic Cyclus archetype that has the capability to update the loading pattern of a reactor core.

	abstract = {The United States is considering the deployment of advanced reactors that require uranium enriched between 5-20\% 235U, often referred to as High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). At the present, there are no commercial facilities in the US to produce HALEU, prompting questions of how to create a dependable supply chain of HALEU to support these reactors. HALEU can be produced through two primary methods: downblending High Enriched Uranium (HEU) and enriching natural uranium. The amount of HEU available and impurities present in the HEU limit downblending capabilities. The Separative Work Unit (SWU) capacity and amount of natural uranium available limit enriching natural uranium capabilities. To understand the resources necessary to commercially produce HALEU with each of these methods, one can quantify the material requirements of transitioning to HALEU-fueled reactors.

In this dissertation, we model the transition from Light Water Reactors to different advanced reactors, considering once-through and closed fuel cycles to determine material requirements for supporting these fuel cycles. Material requirements of interest across this work include the mass of enriched uranium, mass of HALEU, feed uranium, SWU capacity, and the mass of used fuel sent for disposal. We use CYCLUS and publicly-available information about Light Water Reactors, the X-energy Xe-100, the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor, and the NuScale VOYGR to model potential transition scenarios and demonstrate the methodologies developed in this work. To more accurately model the closed fuel cycles, we develop a new CYCLUS archetype, called OpenMCyclus, that couples with OpenMC to dynamically model fuel depletion in a reactor and provide more accurate used fuel compositions. The results of this transition analysis show how the characteristics of the advanced reactors deployed drive the materials required to support the fuel cycle. Closing the fuel cycle reduces the materials required, but the reduction in materials is driven by the amount of material available for reprocessing.

To gain more insight into how transition parameters not considered in the transition analysis affect material requirements, we perform sensitivity analysis on one of the once-through transitions by coupling CYCLUS with Dakota. The results of the sensitivity analysis highlight some of the trade-offs between different reactor designs. One such tradeoff is the increased HALEU demand but decreased used fuel discharged when increasing the Xe-100 deployment and decreasing the VOYGR deployment. Additionally, these results identify the Xe-100 discharge burnup as consistently being one of the most impactful input parameters for this transition, because of how the deployment scheme in this work affects the number of Xe-100s built no matter which advanced reactor build share is specified.

To identify potential transitions that minimize material requirements, we then use the CYCLUS-Dakota to optimize a once-through transition using the genetic algorithms in Dakota. In single-objective problems to minimize the SWU capacity required to produce HALEU and minimize the amount of used nuclear fuel, the algorithm finds solutions that are consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis. The results cannot be taken at face value, because the algorithm did not fully converge and the genetic algorithms do not enforce the applied linear constraint for the advanced reactor build shares to sum to 100\%. However, the results provide guidance on how to adjust the input parameters to optimize the transition for a minimal HALEU SWU or the used fuel mass. Parameter adjustments include maximizing the number of Light Water Reactors that receive license extensions to operate for 80 years. Similar results occur when using this method for a multi-objective problem to minimize both the HALEU SWU capacity and the used fuel mass.

Finally, we use neutronics models of the Xe-100 and Micro Modular Reactor reactor designs to evaluate the steady-state reactor physics performance of downblended HEU in these two designs. We compare the performance of the downblended HEU to nominally enriched fuel, based on the k-eff, Î²eff, energy- and spatially-dependent neutron fluxes, as well as the fuel, moderator, coolant, and total reactivity temperature feedback coefficients. The differences in the fuel compositions leads to differences in each of the metrics. However, these differences are within error of the results of the nominally enriched fuel, or would not prevent the reactor from meeting stated design specifications or operating in a safe state.

The work completed in this dissertation develops and demonstrates a methodology for modeling fuel cycle transitions and understanding the effects of deploying HALEU-fueled reactors in the US. The effects investigated in these example scenarios include various materials and resources required to support these reactors, and how the parameters of the transition affect these requirements. The information generated from this new methodology can be used to develop the necessary infrastructure and supply chains for support a transition to HALEU-fueled reactors. Furthermore, this work explores how the HALEU production method (enriching compared with downblending) affects reactor performance.},

	abstract = {Concerns regarding the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment have led to a global shift towards sustainable energy systems. This study reviewed recent studies on renewable energy composition and electrification abatement in 26 future scenarios of Canada. There is a trend to move from a comprehensive forecasting analysis of multiple energy sectors to a detailed transition analysis of individual sectors, providing more precise recommendations for achieving emission targets. In 2050, the shares of hydropower and nuclear power fluctuate little between scenarios, accounting for about 60\% and 20\%, respectively. The balance between variable renewables and natural gas remains unclear to fill the gap from the replacement of coal-fired power by 2030. The capacity demand for solar and wind under the 2050 GHG-100\% scenario is doubled compared to the results of the 2050 existing policy scenario, which is beyond what is currently planned by government policies. This increased demand for renewable energy sources requires inter-provincial cooperation in electricity planning for countries with mismatches between renewable energy potential and high energy consumption areas. The result highlights the insufficient carbon price signal for coal, which is only 1/7 of that in the road transport sector, emphasizing the need for stronger carbon pricing policies to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. This study provides valuable insights into the prospects of renewable energy and electrification abatement in Canada, highlighting the need for inter-provincial cooperation, precise transition analysis, and effective carbon pricing policies.},

NFCSim is an ideal tool for analysis - of the economics, sustainability, or proliferation resistance - of nonequilibrium, interacting, or evolving reactor fleets. The software couples with a criticality and burnup engine, LACE (Los Alamos Criticality Engine). LACE implements a piecewise-linear, reactor-specific reactivity model for its criticality calculations. This model constructs fluence-dependent reactivity traces for any facility; it is designed to address nuclear economies in which either a steady state is never obtained or is a poor approximation. LACE operates in transient and equilibrium fuel management regimes at the refueling batch level, derives reactor- and cycle-dependent initial fuel compositions, and invokes ORIGEN2.x to carry out burnup calculations.},

These candidate schemes are then examined with a two-dimensional nodal reactor physics model to more accurately calculate feed enrichments, batch burnups, and fuel cycle costs.

	abstract = {Load follow operation without changing soluble boron concentration is desirable for reasons of economic efficiency, automatic control capability and effluent reduction. Many researchers have investigated the implementations of Mechanical Shim (MSHIM) strategy to different types of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) to achieve this goal. However, their studies mainly focused on reactor core calculations. This paper presents the modeling and load follow simulation of the CPR1000 Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) implementing MSHIM operation and control strategy in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The whole plant model consists of the Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) and the Balance of Plant (BOP) system. The NSSS model consisting of the one-dimensional nodal reactor core model, nonequilibrium three-region pressurizer model and nonlinear, time-dependent lumped parameters U-Tube Steam Generator (UTSG) model was first developed. The BOP system model including dynamic models of key components, piping lines and valves was also developed. These models were then integrated in MATLAB/Simulink according to their coupled relationships with relevant control systems built to obtain the whole plant simulation model. Based on this model, the typical 12-3-6-3/100-50-100 daily load follow maneuvers with constant soluble boron concentrations at the Beginning of Cycle (BOC) and End of Cycle (EOC) were simulated under the MSHIM control strategy. The simulation results have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the CPR1000 NPP implementing MSHIM control strategy to achieve daily load follow operations at both BOC and EOC. This study could offer a reference to the engineering application of MSHIM control strategy as well as whole plant simulations of PWRs. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation.

	abstract = {Finding answers to main challenges of nuclear energy, like resource utilisation or waste minimisation, calls for transient fuel cycle modelling. This motivation led to the development of SITON v2.0 a dynamic, discrete facilities/discrete materials and also discrete events fuel cycle simulation code. The physical model of the code includes the most important fuel cycle facilities. Facilities can be connected flexibly; their number is not limited. Material transfer between facilities is tracked by taking into account 52 nuclides. Composition of discharged fuel is determined using burnup tables except for the 2400Â MW thermal power design of the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR2400). For the GFR2400 the FITXS method is used, which fits one-group microscopic cross-sections as polynomial functions of the fuel composition. This method is accurate and fast enough to be used in fuel cycle simulations. Operation of the fuel cycle, i.e. material requests and transfers, is described by discrete events. In advance of the simulation reactors and plants formulate their requests as events; triggered requests are tracked. After that, the events are simulated, i.e. the requests are fulfilled and composition of the material flow between facilities is calculated. To demonstrate capabilities of SITON v2.0, a hypothetical transient fuel cycle is presented in which a 4-unit VVER-440 reactor park was replaced by one GFR2400 that recycled its own spent fuel. It is found that the GFR2400 can be started if the cooling time of its spent fuel is 2Â years. However, if the cooling time is 5Â years it needs an additional plutonium feed, which can be covered from the spent fuel of a Generation III light water reactor. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The closure of the nuclear fuel cycle is currently envisaged with the deployment of Generation IV fast reactors which are able to generate their fuel from fertile 238U or 232Th, and also burn minor actinides arising from legacy wastes and thermal reactors in the nuclear park. The optimization of such fuel cycle strategies requires detailed models, capable of simulating the transition from initial state to equilibrium. Due to the high computational cost of detailed burn-up calculations, most scenario codes use parametrized few group cross-sections to calculate fuel depletion in the reactors. This paper presents a fast and flexible burn-up scheme called FITXS which we applied on the GFR2400 Gas-cooled Fast Reactor and a European Pressurized Reactor MOX fuel assembly. Based on the fitting of one-group cross-sections as functions of the detailed fuel composition, the developed models are able to calculate spent fuel compositions with high accuracy for a wide range of initial compositions in less than one second computational time. In order to demonstrate applicability, the models were integrated into a fuel cycle model containing GFR2400 and European Pressurized Reactors, as well as conventional Light Water Reactors, and the fuel utilization and transmutational properties of the system were analyzed. It was found that the GFR2400 can operate in a closed fuel cycle, with positive breeding gain in the equilibrium. Increased minor actinide feed improves breeding in the GFR2400, but the accumulation of plutonium can be prevented by recycling the excess plutonium as MOX fuel in thermal reactors.

Finally, a case study of the Belgian nuclear fuel cycle phase out has been carried out to show the possible impact of the transmutation of the minor actinides on the nuclear waste by the use of an Accelerator Driven System also known as ADS. Results show that ANICCA accomplishes its main purpose of simulating the scenarios giving similar outcomes to other codes. Regarding the case study, results show a reduction of more than 60\% of minor actinides in the Belgian nuclear cycle when using an ADS, reducing significantly the radiotoxicity and decay heat of the high-level waste and facilitating its management.

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supplyâdemand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), has been designed implemented in CYCLUS. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the DRE allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the DRE enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.

In this work, CYCLUS demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the CYCAMORE reactor module. These results extend the example results in Feng et al. to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy has developed a variety of nuclear fuel cycle performance data using detailed simulations of nuclear fuel cycle reactor stage performance information. Key examples include the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening (E\&S) study and a legacy Transmutation Data Library (TDL) for dynamic fuel cycle simulation. The E\&S study and the TDL contain information from over 600 different fuel cycle option reactor stages. This information is stored in the form of Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and text files. In support of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) Office of Nuclear Technology Research and Development's System Analysis and Integration Campaign (previously known as the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign), this data was collected and imported into a MySQL database using modern software development best practices. We describe why this was conducted, the process for implementation, the verification of the data, and how this increases accessibility and functionality of this data to users and stakeholders. We also identify some of the interfaces and applications, including dynamic fuel cycle simulators that can be coupled to this database and potential future work.

	abstract = {This paper documents fuel cycle depletion validation and code-to-code verification studies for the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) highly enriched uranium (HEU) and proposed low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel designs. In support of HFIR's world-leading performance, transport and depletion simulations are performed to ensure safe operations, design and qualify irradiation experiments, enhance core components and irradiation facilities, and design and characterize LEU fuel designs. Identifying well-validated, computationally efficient codes is required for the success of these efforts. The HFIR Controller, Shift, and VESTA codes were deployed to simulate HEU uraniumâoxide dispersion fuel cycles at 85, 95, and 100 MW operations, as well as LEU fuel cycles operating at 95 MW with uraniumâsilicide dispersion and uraniumâmolybdenum monolithic alloy fuel forms. Excellent agreement between the codes and with experimentally obtained 235U enrichment distributions provides increased confidence in the ability of these codes to model and simulate HFIR's unique core design.

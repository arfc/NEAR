# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Before you get
started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Testing

Tests must be included for every new feature or bug fix. This helps ensure the stability and reliability of the codebase. Each archetype has an associated test file.

## Documentation

Documentation should accompany any updates or changes made to the project. This
helps other contributors and users understand the purpose and functionality of
the code. Documentation takes a couple of forms in this repository, we use
README.md files, issues, and inline comments for documenting decisions. As some
of these cannot be included in a commit, it is up to the contributor to
indicate how they are documenting their addition.

## Pull Requests

Users cannot merge their own pull requests. All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor.

### Writing a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request, please include the following:

- A clear and concise description of the changes made.
- Any relevant references to files or desired features.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Any additional information that may be helpful for reviewers.

PRs are automatically checked to ensure that they include updates to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
**DO NOT MERGE A PR THAT DOESN'T PASS THIS TEST!**

### Tagging Pull Requests

When tagging your pull request, please use one of the following tags:

- Bug Fix: For correcting a bug.
- Documentation: For updates to READMEs, text documents, licenses, or writing.
- New Feature: For substantial contributions that were previously outside the scope of the code.
- Example: For notebooks, code examples, outlines, or sample files.
- Enhancement: For refinement work on existing features that add value to the project.

## Writing an Issue

When creating an issue, please ensure it includes the following:

- A description of the current state and the desired state.
- Specific references to files or desired features.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- A description of how the issue can be closed.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to working with you!
